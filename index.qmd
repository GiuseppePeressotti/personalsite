Welcome! I’m Giuseppe Peressotti, a 4th year PhD candidate in Public Policy and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research mostly focuses on International Political Economy, Trade Policy and Globalization, Digital Governance, and Civil Resistance and Democratization.

More specifically, my work examines topics such as digital provisions in preferential trade agreements, the strategic choice between bilateral and mega-regional PTAs, the networked politics of emerging trade blocs, the interaction of international systems and domestic institutions, and the characteristics defining groups involved in civil resistance and the overturning of democratization processes. My recent and forthcoming publications appear in venues such as the **European Journal of International Relations** and the **Journal of Peace Research**.

I have also been teaching a number of undergrad-level courses at UTD, including International Trade Policy, Political Economy of East Asia, Research Design, and International Relations. Linking my research activity and my teaching, I am committed to producing accessible, data-driven research that contributes to the study of globalization and institutional change.

As for my personal hobbies: I love lifting weights, I am a huge espresso nerd, and I am on a quest to find all the best coffee shops/roasters from the cities I visit. I also met Faker in real life once, which is neat for those that know him.

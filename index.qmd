Welcome! I’m Giuseppe Peressotti, a 4th year PhD candidate in Public Policy and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research mostly focuses on International Political Economy, Trade Policy and Globalization, Digital Governance, and Civil Resistand and Democratization.

More specifically, my work examines topics such as digital provisions in preferential trade agreements, the strategic choice between bilateral and mega-regional PTAs, the networked politics of emerging trade blocs, and the characteristics defining groups involved in civil resistance and the overturning of democratization processes. My recent and forthcoming publications appear in venues such as the **European Journal of International Relations** and the **Journal of Peace Research**.

I also teach courses in International Trade Policy, Political Economy of East Asia, Research Design, and International Relations, and I am committed to producing accessible, data-driven research that contributes to the study of globalization and institutional change.

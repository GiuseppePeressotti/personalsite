Welcome! I am Giuseppe Peressotti, 1st year PhD student in Public Policy and Political Economy from [The University of Texas at Dallas(EPPS)](https://epps.utdallas.edu/).

My main field of study would be International Trade, with a focus on Preferential Trade Agreements. Some of my specific research topics include Digital Provisions in PTAs, the relationship between foreign policy and trade interconnection between states, and the influence of trade ties on the preferential procurement of goods.

Keep following me for more updates on further work and publications (soon to come).

You can find my CV [here](cv_peressotti.pdf) (WORK IN PROGRESS).
